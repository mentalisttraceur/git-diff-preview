# Example Git Repo with Interesting Diffs

This repo contains a commit which is useful for
seeing how diffs are displayed, for example
when trying out
[Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) or
[Difftastic](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic).

To see the diffs, try `git log -p`
or `git reset HEAD~1 && git diff`.

(The contents of this repo started a snapshot of
